Nahir's Project Euler Answers
=============================

Just posting my answers to the problems posted at [Project Euler](http://www.projecteuler.net)

Compilation
-----------

Essentially run make and set p to the problem number of the form xxx. As an example, say I wanted to compile problem 6, I would run:

	make p=006

Run: 

	make clean

To clean up.
